            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>REASONS FOR THE <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company's ſending out <hi>Twelve</hi> SHIPS to <hi>INDIA</hi> about the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>January</hi> next.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company had Four Ships arriv'd from <hi>India</hi> in <hi>Septemb.</hi> 1691. and in <hi>October</hi> they deliver'd into the Honorable Houſe of Commons a Paper ſaid to contain a true Account of all their Stock both at home and abroad, wherein they make their Eſtate then in <hi>England</hi> to amount to about <hi>Thirty Nine Thouſand Pounds:</hi> And in that they value their <hi>Dead Stock</hi> at about <hi>Ten Thouſand Five Hundred Pounds,</hi> for their Buildings <hi>and Equipage for a Troop of Horſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to paſs over all Reflections on the many Notorious Falſities in that Paper, It may ſuffice here to obſerve, That were this Article true, 'Tis yet inconſiderable, even to a Scandal; For that our <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company ſhould have Four great Ships from <hi>India:</hi> whoſe Cargoes they valu'd in their aforeſaid Account at <hi>Three Hundred and Seventy Thouſand Pounds,</hi> and that all that, conjoyn'd with every thing they could poſſibly pretend to here before, ſhould yet altogether, according to their own accompting, make the Total of their <hi>Quick Stock</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> no more than <hi>Twenty Eight Thouſand Five Hundred Pounds, <hi>Is too plain a Diſcovery of their ill Condition.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>But tho they were, by their own Confeſſion, thus utterly deſtitute of a ſufficient Stock to carry on the Trade, yet they obtain'd leave to ſend out Five Ships in the Spring, wherein, if they adventur'd any thing for account of the <hi>General Joynt-Stock,</hi> It muſt be borrow d; For the foreſaid ſmall Sum was as little as they cou'd reſerve for incident Charges <hi>and Secret Service.</hi> But 'tis well known, that a great part of the Effects laden on thoſe Ships, were for the particular Accounts of a few ruling Gentlemen amongſt them, with ſuch Friends as they pleas'd to admit into the Concern; together with the <hi>Armenians,</hi> whom, to the great Diſhonour and Detriment of the Nation, they have of late introduc'd into the Trade. And to cover theſe private Concerns from publick Notice, ſo that they might paſs as the Company's own Goods, the Proprietors were oblig'd to let them go under the Company's Mark, and be enter'd at the <hi>Cuſtom-Houſe</hi> in their Name.</p>
            <p>Since this, they have had no more than One Ship from <hi>India,</hi> which is the <hi>Kempthorn,</hi> lately arriv'd, and after ſhe had been detain'd above Two Years in the Country, and the Commander at laſt forc'd to proteſt for his Diſpatch, ſhe is now return'd about a Hundred and Fifty Tuns Dead Freighted. Neither were the Goods ſhe brings provided by the Company's own Stock; For, by the Confeſſion of a Principal Member of their Committe, their Servants have, for this occaſion, made uſe of the Monies of particular Merchants of <hi>London</hi> remaining in their hands, to the amount of <hi>Fifteen Thouſand Pounds,</hi> for which they have drawn Bills on the Company; And that is at leaſt one half of the Coſt of her Cargo.</p>
            <p>This is the beſt Face they themſelves can put upon their Affairs here at home: And as to their Condition abroad, if the Evidence in the laſt Seſſion of Parliament were not ſufficient, There is now come by the foreſaid Ship <hi>Kempthorn</hi> a further Confirmation of the whole Matter, in a Letter from one of their principal Factors, to an Honourable Member of the Houſe of Commons, Declaring, <hi>That the</hi> Engliſh <hi>had lost their Eſteem in all Places, That the Companies Servants were kept as Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners in the City of</hi> Suratt, <hi>And that the Natives were ſo Incens'd againſt them for their late Hoſtilities, That they could ſcarce re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain from treating them at preſent after a more ſevere Manner, tho their own Intereſt required it till they had recovered ſatisfaction for thoſe Injuries: Which, if not comply'd with, 'twas fear'd their Rage would drive them to Extremities: And moreover that there was ſo great a Debt upon the Company at that Place, as would demand a large Stock to be ſent out to diſcharge it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, Tho their Affairs labour under all theſe diſmal Circumſtances, which render them wholly Incapable to act as a Company, according to the true Intent of their Charter; and make it apparent, that this valuable Trade will be intirely loſt to the Nation, if any longer continued in their Hands: Yet thoſe Gentlemen who preſide in the preſent Management, are Maſters of ſo great Aſſurance, To Petition the King in Council, for leave to ſend no leſs than Twelve Ships to <hi>India</hi> this Seaſon; And they were ſo ſucceſsful on <hi>Thurſday</hi> laſt, to obtain a Grant for half that Number. <hi>But</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>'TIS humbly Hop'd and Pray'd, That our Honourable Repreſentatives, who are now (in purſuance of His Gracious Majeſties Meſſage to them) Conſidering of the moſt proper Methods to Preſerve, Improve, and Establiſh this Trade to a National Advantage, Will be pleaſed to Interpoſe with their prevalent Applications to His Majeſty, to prevent ſo great a Prejudice to the Publick, as muſt unavoidably be the Conſequence of permitting theſe Ships to proceed; At least until it be firſt effectually Provided,</hi> That they ſhall carry out no Effects but what are intirely for Account of their <hi>General Ioynt-Stock,</hi> And give ſufficient Security to diſcharge all Debts and Demands on them in <hi>India.</hi>
